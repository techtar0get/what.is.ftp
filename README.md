FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is the oldest, most widely used modern protocol for transferring files over the Internet. Simple FTP uses a client-server model, in which a client requests data, and then a server provides it.In B2B use cases, each trading partner generally uses a clear-text sign-in protocol for authentication.

## How Does FTP Work?

FTP connection needs two parties to establish and communicate on the network. To do that, users need to have permission by providing credentials to the FTP server. Some public FTP servers may not require credentials to access their files. The practice is common in a so-called anonymous FTP.

There are two distinct communication channels while establishing an FTP connection. The first one is called the command channel where it initiates the instruction and response. The other one is called a data channel, where the distribution of data happens.

To get or transfer a file, an authorized user will use the protocol to request on creating changes in the server. In return, the server will grant that access. This session is known as the active connection mode.

The distribution in active mode might face a problem if a firewall is protecting the userâ€™s machine. The firewall usually does not allow any unauthorized sessions from an external party.

The passive mode is used if that issue occurs. In this mode, the user establishes both command and the data channel. This mode then asks the server to listen rather than to attempt to create a connection back to the user.

## How to Use FTP

**The three most common ways of using FTP include:**

* Via a web browser: With a web browser, you do not need any special software or a client to download files from servers that provide for FTP sites.
* A general user interface (GUI) FTP client: These third-party applications enable users to connect and then send files over FTP.
* Command-line FTP: Major operating systems come equipped with FTP client capabilities as a command line.

## What is an FTP Port?

An FTP port is a communication endpoint and allows data transfer between a computer and a server. A computer's operating system only uses a specific number of ports, which are necessary for software to connect through a network. An FTP port is required for the client and server to quickly exchange files.
